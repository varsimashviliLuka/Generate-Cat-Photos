# Generate Cat Photos
This Python program generates cat pictures using an API and stores them in database.

I've made this project using libraries such as 'requests', 'json' and 'sqlite3', this program generates images of cats using API and stores them into the database called 'imagesofcats.db' (you can change the name of it on line 54). This program has 3 main functions: 'generate_cat()', 'read_cats()' and 'detele_cats()', first one genetares 10 cat, second one reads cats from database and third one clears database.

To make this program work you just simply open Terminal or Command Prompt (CMD) in the same directory as dowloaded file and type 'pip install -r requirements.txt', this will install required libraries. to run this program you type 'py app.py' (On Windows os) or 'python3 app.py' (On Linux os).

Enjoy,
